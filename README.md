# Discourse Roblox Auth

No you can't use this yet - Roblox has not started allowing users into the OAuth alpha program. This plugin was made entirely with information available from Roblox's [OpenID discovery document](https://apis.roblox.com/oauth/.well-known/openid-configuration)

I don't even know if this works yet

Discourse Meta topic will be created when the alpha program starts (if I get in that is)
