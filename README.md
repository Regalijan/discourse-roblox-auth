# Discourse Roblox Auth

~~No you can't use this yet - Roblox has not started allowing users into the OAuth alpha program. This plugin was made entirely with information available from Roblox's [OpenID discovery document](https://apis.roblox.com/oauth/.well-known/openid-configuration)~~

You can use this now*, however, Roblox does not allow third-party access to email addresses. Until there is some way to retrieve emails, most likely I won't consider this to be officially supported.

*Must be ID verified
